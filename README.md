# AutoFileCreation - C#

A basic utility which creates files within the given input range. Let say you want 1000 files for some sort of testing or bulk uploading rather than creating those manually, this program can be used.

In App.config, you need to specify the number of files need to be created (for e.g 1000) and the location where these files need to be created on disk (e.g D: drive).
